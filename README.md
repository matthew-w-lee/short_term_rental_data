# Short-term Rental Data App

## About
This project provides a database for the processing and storage of data regarding the performance of short-term rentals in the Chicagoland area. It takes data that was periodically scraped from Airbnb and AirDNA (a short-term rental data aggregation site) and enters it into a PostgreSQL database. 

The data contained in the PostgresSQL database was then used with other data visualization frameworks for analysis, namely Apache Superset and Microsoft Excel.

The data for which this project was built is no longer available. Thus this project is no longer maintained and may or may not be operational.

Although a full git commit history is not available for this project, the commit immediately before the latest commit is the boiler plate Ruby on Rails application. This should provide a diff in the commit history that shows all of the changes and additions implemented in connection with the work on this project.
